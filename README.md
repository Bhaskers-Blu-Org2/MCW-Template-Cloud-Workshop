# Microsoft Cloud Workshop Template

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION** This respository is the template for Microsoft Cloud Workshop (MCW) content.  Each workshop is maintained in its own repository.  This repository contains the template for creating a new workshop and a pointer to the individual cloud workshop repositories. Each workshop is named 'MCW-workshop-topic-name`  and can be found in https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-workshop-topic-name

## Maintained Workshops
